# dinner-and-a-movie
Our website is made for the indecisive person. We can generate a random meal and a random movie so you dont have to think of what to watch, or eat. Let the website decide for you!

## Home Page
Our homepage has a button that triggers two api calls and displays a random meal and a random movie onto the screen. If the user is not satisfied with one, they may click the refresh button on either the meal or movie option to get another.
